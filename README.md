# Experimental AWS OSCAL Content

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering _experimental_ Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) content for public review and feedback. This OSCAL package is experimental and may contain errors or inconsistencies with other published information. Future versions of this OSCAL content, if any, may not be backwards compatible. 

## Available Content

This repository contains OSCAL component-definition files in JSON format describing AWS regions and services. See the [AWS Component Definitions](docs/COMPONENTS.md) document for details.

Additional detail about each service will be added to these files. Please [open an issue](/issues/new) to let us know what content is most beneficial to you.     

You may also want to try the [OSCAL MCP Server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp-server-for-oscal/), which can help you understand the content in this project, how to use it, and OSCAL in general. 

## We want to hear from you!
Our goals for this experiment are to understand customer interest and use-cases for machine-readable compliance artifacts. To that end, AWS needs your feedback about the quality and usefulness of this content.
If you have questions, suggestions or concerns, please [open an issue](/issues/new).
